-> works with rational and integers both
-> retains output of last operation so that output can be used for further calculation

What does the code of calculator contain??? ----------->>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-> Rational class is defined where
1. one primary constructor with two parameters is defined (in declaration of Rational class itself)
2. one auxiliary constructor with one parameter is defined
3. two data members are defined "numer" (i.e. numerator) and "denom" (i.e. denominator)
4. inbuilt "require" method is used to check whether value entered by user for denominator is 0, if it is zero then exception is generated with message
5. gcd method is defined which receives two parameters of int type and returns one parameter of int type
6. method overloading is used to overload +,-,*,/ operators to work with both rational and integer numbers
-> object class "Calculator" is defined where
1. NumberChoice() method is defined which gives two options to user i.e.
   whether user wants to work with rational number or with integer (whole) number
   [NOTE -> user can enter + or - values both for rational and whole numbers]
2. makeRational() method is defined which creates a rational number if user chooses to work with rational number
2. Options() method is defined which provides options of operations to user i.e. add, subtract, multiply, divide
3. Compute() method is defined where
   input(s) from user is taken either for rational or for integer (whole) number
   call to overloaded =,-,*,/ method is made depending upon option of operations chosen by the user
4. inside main() method, do while loop is run until user presses 'y' to exit,
   otherwise user can continue to perform operation while retaining last value of operation
